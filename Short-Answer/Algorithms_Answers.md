#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
Line 1 is O(1) constant complexity
Line 2 is O(n * n * n) => O(n ^ 3) cubic complexity
Line 3 is O(1) constant complexity

Adding them up: 0(1) + O(n * n * n) + 0(1) = 0(n ^ 3) which is a cubic runtime

b)
Line 1 is O(1) constant complexity
Line 2 is O(n) linear complexity
Line 3 is O(1) constant complexity
Line 4 is O(n * n) quadratic complexity
Line 5 is O(1) constant complexity
Line 6 is O(1) constant complexity

Adding it all up: O(n ^ 2 + n + 4) gives O(n ^ 2) which is a Quadratic Time


c)
Line 2 is O(1) constant complexity
Line 3 is O(1) constant complexity
Line 5 is O(n) linear complexity

Adding it all up: O(n + 2) gives O(n) which is a Linear Time
